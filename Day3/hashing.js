//Character hashing

/*
    How can we use hashing in characters?

    So for that we have to thing called ASCII characters which are represented by a single byte (8 bits).

    Example:-

    lowercase a = 97;
    lowercase z = 122;

    Now how can we find any character from this ASCII?

    if we represent f(102)

    ASCII(f) - ASCII(a) = 102 - 91 = 5
    Now what is 5 here.

    a = 0;
    b = 1;
    c = 2;
    d = 3;
    e = 4;
    f = 5;

    so from this formula we faound num 5 and that represents f.

    final formula = char - a
